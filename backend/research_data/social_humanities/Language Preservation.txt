Title: Language Preservation in the Age of Globalization

Globalization has accelerated the dominance of a few major languages—such as English, Mandarin, and Spanish—at the expense of thousands of minority and indigenous languages. According to UNESCO, nearly 40% of the world's 7,000 languages are at risk of extinction. This linguistic loss represents more than the disappearance of words; it also means the erosion of cultural identity, traditional knowledge, and unique worldviews.

Language preservation efforts vary widely. Some focus on documentation through dictionaries and grammars, while others involve community-led revitalization through education, media, and everyday use. The rise of digital tools, such as language-learning apps and AI-based transcription, has offered new hope for endangered languages.

However, preserving a language requires more than technical resources. It demands political will, community engagement, and the transmission of language across generations. Schools that incorporate native languages into the curriculum have shown higher success rates in both cultural retention and academic performance.

In conclusion, language preservation is a vital aspect of cultural sustainability. In an interconnected world, maintaining linguistic diversity ensures that humanity retains its full spectrum of knowledge and expression.
